## Running Models
- ADD INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING MODELS
- requirements, and then steps to run

## Generating Data
- ADD INSTRUCTIONS FOR GENERATING DATA
- links to data, requirements, steps to run pipelines

## File Structure
### Data
- Within the Data directory there is a subdirectory which corresponds to each data set
- Within each subdirectory is:
    - originals: Directory containing original data
    - model_Pipeline.ipynb: Notebook to generate data in required for for model
    - model: Directory containing data in the form required for the model
    - labels.xxx: Labels containing falls start and end times

### Models
- Within the Models directory there is a subdirectory which corresponds to each model
